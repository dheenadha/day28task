<p align='center'>This is a React-based shopping cart application</p>

## Overview
-----------

This project is a hands-on exercise to learn and demonstrate the use of React's Context API. The application is a simple shopping cart that allows users to add and remove products from their cart, update quantities, and view their subtotal.

## Focus on Context API
-----------------------

The primary goal of this project is to learn and understand how to use React's Context API to manage state and props across components. The Context API provides a way to share data between components without having to pass props down manually.

## Features
------------

* Display a list of products in the cart
* Allow users to add and remove products from the cart
* Update product quantities in real-time
* Calculate and display the subtotal of the cart
* Provide a summary total of the cart contents

## Technologies Used
--------------------

* React
* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap (for styling)
* Context API (for state management)

## What I Learned
-----------------

Through this project, I learned how to:

* Create a context and provider to manage state
* Use the `useContext` hook to access context data in components
* Update context data using the `useContext` hook
* Use the Context API to share data between components

## Challenges and Takeaways
---------------------------

* One of the biggest challenges was understanding how to properly use the Context API to manage state and props.
* I learned that the Context API is a powerful tool for managing state, but it requires careful planning and implementation to avoid complexity and performance issues.
* I also learned the importance of properly documenting and testing code to ensure that it is maintainable and scalable.

## Getting Started
